This is a small project I did to familiarize myself with RxJava2 and various online APIs (Twitter / Github).

Given an input file with usernames with the following format:
<username1>
<username2>
[...]

The program, when started, writes the usernames which belong to the maximal clique of a graph, where
two usernames are connected when they either belong to the same github organization or follow each other on twitter.

How to start:
You need to set your own Bearer token in the build.gradle for the twitter api to work.
./gradlew run -Dexec.args=<input> <output>
